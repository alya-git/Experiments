        <h2>Tulsi</h2>
        <h3>Ocimum tenuiflorum <span>( tul‧si )</span></h3>
        <p>
          The tulsi plant is an erect, many-branched shrub, 30–60 cm (12–24 in)
          tall with hairy stems. Leaves are green or purple; they are simple,
          petioled, with an ovate, up to 5 cm (2.0 in)-long blade, which usually
          has a slightly toothed margin; they are strongly scented and have a
          decussate phyllotaxy.
          The purplish flowers are placed in close whorls on elongated
          racemes.The three main morphotypes cultivated in India and Nepal are
          Ram tulsi (the most common type, with broad bright green leaves that
          are slightly sweet), the less common purplish green-leaved (Krishna
          tulsi) and the common wild vana tulsi.
